I'm Muhammad Zain Momin, a 22-year-old male currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. Proficient in HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, and C++, I blend coding prowess with a passion for technology. Beyond the screen, you'll find me at the gym, embracing a healthy lifestyle. My heart races not only for lines of code but also for the speed of cars, the thrill of video games, the roar of fighter planes, and the dynamics of political discourse. Join me on my journey to explore the intersection of code, creativity, and curiosity.
